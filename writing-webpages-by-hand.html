            <p>20-03-2019</p>
            <p>Last week it was pi day. So that day i tinkered a bit with my old raspberry pi, just to burn the dust out of it's circuits. For a project i had in mind, i wanted to boot the pi into the console. Once i was in the quiet of the console, i had no way to look things up on the internet.</p>
            <p>It was only yesterday i started  experimenting with the text based browser 'lynx'. None of my own sites really worked well in it, because they are mostly images and animations. But even my Supernapie blog was just a blank screen, because it is made with React. Google's homepage seemed to work very well. There are even input fields in the lynx browser, and the search results can be navigated. But on some sites, everything was mangled into something unstructured. They were probably readable when the css was applied. Some started with long lists of meaningless links, that are probably hidden by a fancy flyout menu in a real browser.</p>
            <p>This got me thinking: why not design for text-based first. It will automatically be mobile first, search engine optimized and easy to navigate with a keyboard.</p>
